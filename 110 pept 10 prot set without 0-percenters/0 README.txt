1. fill in the peps-assignment.xls with the frequency for proteins and their peptides
-> on the bottom (PINK background) it will sum up the total number of peptides per protein. Copy this into "dyeseq_in_prot_match_count.csv"
-> on the right (YELLOW background) it will calculate the P(Xi|Zj) values for the protein inferring step. Copy this into "p_xi_given_zj prot_infer input.csv"
